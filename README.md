# TriangleGame Web App

## Synopsis

Name:  Triangle Game

This is a web game application.

It is based on a real game board from "Cracker Barrel Old Country Store" given to
 me by a colleague on a business trip.  I loved the game but kept losing pieces in the car and on the plane.  So, I decided to replicate the game electronically.  Below are pictures of the "real game"  and the current web game.
